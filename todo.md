To create a simplified version of the NaturaLens app following the roadmap, here’s a concise implementation plan focused on an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that captures the core value:

---

**1. Core Features for the Simplified MVP**

- Real-time recognition of a small set of natural objects (e.g., a few mountain peaks and tree species).
- Overlay basic info (object name, simple fact).
- Static AR filters (one or two color grading effects).
- Ability to capture and save photos with overlays.
- No user accounts, social features, or advanced monetization.

---

**2. Technology Stack**

- **Engine:** Unity (2022.3 or newer).
- **AR:** Unity AR Foundation package for cross-platform AR (iOS and Android).
  - [Unity AR Foundation Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@latest/)
- **ML Model for Recognition:** MobileNetV2 (pre-trained or with minimal fine-tuning).
- **Backend:** Not required for MVP; all recognition runs on-device.

---

**3. Implementation Steps**

1. **Set Up Unity Project**
   - Install Unity Hub and Unity 2022.3+.
   - Create a new 3D project.
   - Add AR Foundation and ARCore/ARKit packages via Package Manager.

2. **Camera & AR Setup**
   - Configure AR Session and AR Camera in your Scene.
   - Enable plane detection and tracking for basic AR experience.

3. **Object Recognition Integration**
   - Convert or obtain a lightweight MobileNetV2 model in ONNX format.
   - Import Unity Barracuda package for on-device ML inference.
   - Load ONNX model and run inference on camera frames (see [Barracuda Getting Started](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.barracuda@1.0/manual/GettingStarted.html)).
   - Display recognized object labels as UI overlays.

4. **AR Filters**
   - Use Unity’s Post-Processing (URP/Volume components) to create one or two color grading filters.
   - Allow user to toggle between filters.

5. **Photo Capture**
   - Add a UI button to capture the current AR view (use Unity’s ScreenCapture API).
   - Save images locally on the device.

6. **Basic UI**
   - Simple overlay for object info.
   - Filter toggle button.
   - Capture button.

---

**4. What’s NOT Included in MVP**

- User accounts, profiles, hashtags, likes, or map view.
- Cloud/server-side backend.
- Monetization or subscription features.

---

**5. Next Steps**

- Once MVP is stable, gradually add social features (user accounts, hashtags, map-based feed) and expand recognition database as per the roadmap.
